                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some recent highly dependent packages have caused issues either because of <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/169582189317/incident-report-npm-inc-operations-incident-of">takedowns</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cyib2MgvdM">security vulnerabilities</a>.
                        Starting from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16126526">Hackernews</a>, I wanted to see what was important and what was impact when changes were made.
                        It took awhile and the implementation is not the best, but I feel like the results are interesting.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <p>
                        The approach is just brute force recursion of the dependency tree (not development dependencies).
                        The score is simple exponential decay starting with <code>1</code> for a direct dependency and <code>0.5</code> for a sub-dependency and so on.
                        A simple circular dependency check as added.
                        Additionally a count of how many packages were impacted was tracked which is simply a count of how many times a package was within a dependency tree.
                        It took around 3-4 days to run through.

                    <h2>Notes</h2>
                    <p>
                        I discovered a few odities in 1+ million packages.  Like this hillarious package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ifyouwanttogetthesumoftwonumberswherethosetwonumbersarechosenbyfindingthelargestoftwooutofthreenumbersandsquaringthemwhichismultiplyingthembyitselfthenyoushouldinputthreenumbersintothisfunctionanditwilldothatforyou" title="ifyouwanttogetthesumoftwonumberswherethosetwonumbersarechosenbyfindingthelargestoftwooutofthreenumbersandsquaringthemwhichismultiplyingthembyitselfthenyoushouldinputthreenumbersintothisfunctionanditwilldothatforyou">ifyouwanttogetthesumoftwonumberswherethosetwonumbers...</a>.
                        Or there is a number of <a href="https://github.com/carsonreinke/node-vip/blob/master/score-dependencies.js#L64">circular dependency testing packages</a> which I simply ignored because they just took forever.
                        And then there was some very strange set of packages from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~lecomte">"lecomtegs"</a>, they all sound very cryptic and probably meant to be abusive, I simply ignored them.
